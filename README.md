# Simple login page

This SPA has only two routes. First is a login page, where you can either "create a new user" or login with "existing credentials". The second route is the "main" page, but there's nothig there, it is only used to transition from successful login attempt.

All requests are mocked. When you click the submit button you have random 1 in 5 chance to "encounter" an error, this is just to showcase a network error case. Just try one more time.
